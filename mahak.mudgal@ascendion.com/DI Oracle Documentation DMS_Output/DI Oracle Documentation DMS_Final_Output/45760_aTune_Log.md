Iteration 1:

Step 1:
- Extracted the agent's role, goal, backstory, description, and expected output using the metadata extractor.
- Created the Goal file and Instruction file and wrote both to GitHub at mahak.mudgal@ascendion.com/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Output/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Instruction/.
- GitHub URLs:
  - 45760_Goal.md: https://github.com/ELANSURIYAA/aTune/blob/main/mahak.mudgal@ascendion.com/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Output/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Instruction/45760_Goal.md
  - 45760_Instruction.md: https://github.com/ELANSURIYAA/aTune/blob/main/mahak.mudgal@ascendion.com/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Output/DI Oracle Documentation DMS_Instruction/45760_Instruction.md
- Validation: I checked that 45760_Goal.md and 45760_Instruction.md exist in the correct location with content present. Both files verified.
- Decision: All outputs verified so I am proceeding to Step 2.

[ERROR] Attempt 1 of 3 — Executer agent workflow execution failed with 403 Access denied for the action execute

[ERROR] Attempt 2 of 3 — Executer agent workflow execution failed with 403 Access denied for the action execute

[ERROR] Attempt 3 of 3 — Executer agent workflow execution failed with 403 Access denied for the action execute

[ERROR] All 3 attempts failed for Step 2 - Execute Agent Instructions. Stopping aTune process. Reason: 403 Access denied for the action execute - the workflow execution endpoint is rejecting the request with an authorization error.
